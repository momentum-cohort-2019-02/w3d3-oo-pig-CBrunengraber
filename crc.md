##########Look at the flow of the game, and how information will go back and forth with each other #######
###### Don't quit!!! Figure it the fuck out! ##############
###################### Replicate class structure/interface so they will interface properly##############       
##### Input and output should be in small independent methods ###### - solid/rise ideas from class
########## test players for test are helpful because they don't require outside input ########
Game, Human player, computer player, maybe die as a class - mainly for testing
